# MarkDairy Web App

The app allows you to write your diary and use your Github as storage for dairy records.

https://siavol.github.io/markdairy-web/

## Configuration

1. [Create a GitHub repository](https://github.com/new).
   It is recommended to make it `private` unless you do not want everybody to read your records.
2. Create [fine-grained personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) with
   `"Contents"` repository permissions (write).
3. Open the app and configure your repository and token.
